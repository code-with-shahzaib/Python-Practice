# Python Practice

This repository documents my Python learning process through practice-based problem solving.

Instead of passively completing courses, I focus on solving practice problems first. When I encounter concepts I don’t fully understand, I pause, learn them properly, and then apply them immediately in code. This approach helps me build strong fundamentals and real problem-solving skills.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Reinforce Python fundamentals through hands-on practice  
- Build consistency by coding regularly and committing progress publicly  
- Create a transparent record of my learning journey  
- Develop a foundation for future projects in software development and AI  

This repository is not meant to showcase perfect or advanced code. It is meant to show **growth, learning, and consistency**.

## Learning Approach

1. Solve practice problems from a structured Python course or resource  
2. Identify gaps in understanding  
3. Learn missing concepts in a focused way  
4. Refactor or improve solutions when necessary  
5. Commit progress regularly  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics for clarity and progression:
- Basics/ # Syntax, variables, input/output
- Data_Structures/ # Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Control_Flow/ # Conditions and loops
- Functions/ # Functions and scope
- OOPS/ # Object-oriented programming
- Modules/ # Modules and packages

Each folder contains small scripts and exercises related to that topic.

## Long-Term Vision

This repository is part of my broader goal to grow as a Python developer and aspiring AI engineer. The skills built here will feed into future projects, automation tools, and eventually more advanced software and AI systems under my long-term initiative, **DreamTechX**.

## Status

- Actively maintained  
- Updated regularly as I progress through practice sets  
- Focused on fundamentals and steady improvement

Consistency over perfection.
